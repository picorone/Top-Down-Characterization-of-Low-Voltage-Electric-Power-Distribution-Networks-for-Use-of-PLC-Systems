	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
	\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} needs and demands for connectivity among devices and machines have been putting a huge research efforts for introducing novel generations of telecommunications systems that are suitable for assisting  
	Smart City \cite{Andrisano2018}, the \ac{IoT} \cite{Minoli2017}, Smart Grid \cite{Masera2018} and Industry $4.0$ \cite{Wollschlaeger2017} applications. As a matter of fact, these applications can only succeed being assisted by ubiquitous, pervasive, energy efficient and sustainable telecommunication infrastructures  which can, eventually, integrate the existing telecommunication technologies in homes, vehicles, buildings, among other  facilities. 
	
	Currently, it is well-established that there is no single telecommunication technology that meets all requirements necessary for interconnecting the existing devices and machines because the number, diversity and complexity of devices and machine are remarkable. Therefore, the implementation of a wide variety of telecommunication systems capable of maximizing the use of the available resource becomes mandatory \cite{Mehmood2017, M.B.A.Dib2018}.
	
	In the realm of the aforementioned applications, \ac{PLC} emerges as a natural option extensively  evaluated in the literature \cite{Yan2013, Han2017, Artale2018}. 
	One of the great motivations behind  \ac{PLC} systems lies in the low-cost associated with its deployment, as well the great potential for network convergence  \cite{Willie2006,M.B.A.Dib2018,Oliveira2017}. 
	Furthermore, \ac{PLC} systems can be easily adapted for  measuring, monitoring and controlling electricity, water and gas supply and consumption.
	On the other hand, it is recognized that electric power systems constitute a challenging medium for data communication purposes because they were designed for energy transmission and distribution \cite{Corripio2006,Musolino2008,Zimmermann2000}. 
	
	Several contributions have addressed measurement and characterization of electric power systems for data communication considering both narrowband ($0-500$ kHz) \cite{Liu2011,Gassara2014} and broadband ($1.7-100$ MHz) \cite{Anatory2009, Tonello2014}. Note that broadband and narrowband in \ac{PLC} field follow the definition stated in \cite{Oliveira2018}. \textbf{[PICORONE: FROM THIS POINT, WE NEED TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE JOURNAL PAPERS ADDRESSING MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PLC CHANNELS IN INDOOR AND OUTDOOR FACILITIES (BROADBAND AND NARROWBAND). THE PARAGRAPH HAS TO END WITH THE PAPERS ABOUT OUTDOOR PLC CHANNELS]} \color{red}
	
	
	Indoor measurement campaigns were conducted in the American residences \cite{Liu1999, O'Mahony2006} besides other countries, such as France \cite{Tlich2008,Tlich2008a,Schneider2012}, Italy ~\cite{Tonello2014}, Germany, Spain, Belgium, United Kingdom~\cite{Schneider2012}, and Brazil \cite{Oliveira2017}. 
	
	Focusing on the outdoor PLC scenario, some few contributions related to developed countries can be highlighted. An outdoor measurement campaign was carried out in Germany to evaluate the \ac{ACA}, noise and time dispersion of PLC channels. Results of a modest campaign have been reported with the objective of characterizing the \ac{LV-PDN} in India \cite{Prasad2001}. In this campaign, the \ac{ACA}, temporal delay and \ac{CB} were evaluated. In China, the \ac{ACA} of outdoor PLC channel was evaluated in the frequency band from $2$ to $20$~MHz~\cite{Zhai2011}.\color{black}
	
	%To facilitate  the physical \color{black} access to the network, the propagation characteristics of \ac{PLC} signals in indoor low voltage networks have been well analyzed in the literature \cite{Zimmermann2002, Tlich2008, Tlich2008a, Tonello2014}.
	%Although, the knowledge of medium characteristics is extremely important, papers with focus on \ac{LV-PDN} can be rarely found in the literature. 
	%It is mainly due  to the complexity of conducting the measurement campaigns in these environments. In \cite{Liu2000}  where a measurement campaign was carried out in Germany, the \ac{ACA}, noise, and \ac{RMS-DS} of the \ac{PLC} outdoor channels (\ac{LV-PDN}) in the 1~MHz up to 30~MHz frequency band were evaluated. 
	%The results of a small measurement campaign was presented in \cite{Prasad2001} as it aims to characterize the \ac{LV-PDN} for outdoor \ac{PLC} communication in India.
	%Ref.  \cite{Prasad2001} reports some results which are limited to the frequency band from 1~MHz to 30~MHz and evaluates the \ac{ACA}, \ac{RMS-DS} and \ac{CB}. 
	%For outdoor \ac{PLC} channels, Ref. \cite{Liu2000} reports the parameter value of 1.4~$\mu$s  considering a single frequency of 3.75~MHz and of 0.8~$\mu$s for the 5~MHz frequency. 
	%However, it has not been clearly defined whether these values represent \ac{CIR} duration or the \ac{RMS-DS} value. 
	%Values of \ac{RMS-DS} between 0.145~$\mu$s and 0.228~$\mu$s in the frequency range of 1.7~MHz up to 30~MHz  have been  reported by Ref. \cite{Prasad2001}.
	
	\textbf{[PICORONE: HERE WE NEED TO HAVE A PARAGRAPH DISCUSSION WHAT IS THE PROBLEM(S) RELATED TO MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PLC CHANNELS. IT JUSTIFY OUR WORK, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PAPAGRAPH.]}
	
	\color{red} In general, the behavior of \ac{LV-PDN} as a data communication medium is not yet well-known. It is mainly due to the complexity of conducting the measurement campaigns in these environments. Outdoor measurement campaigns require mobilization of many resources, such as specialized electrician teams, special vehicles, robust measuring instruments, and safety training for all those involved with the field measurements. In Brazil, electric power utilities require safety training in works with electricity \cite{NR10} and works at height \cite{NR35} for all people involved. 
	
	In order to mitigate the knowledge gap on the characteristics of the outdoor PLC channel, especially of Brazilian outdoor electric power grids, we aims to increase the scientific knowledge about the characteristics of \ac{LV-PDN} as a means of data communication. Towards this end, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\color{black}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The discussion of an extensive measurement campaign conducted on the Brazilian outdoor and low-voltage electric power grids covering the frequency band between $1.7$ and $100$~MHz. The measurement campaign covers an urban area.	
		%The measurement campaign was carried out during \color{blue} fourteen \color{black} days in two distinct \color{blue} quarters \color{black} of the city of Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil;	 
		\item The characterization of Brazilian outdoor \ac{PLC} channels through the use of  \ac{ACA}, \ac{RMS-DS}, \ac{CB} and \ac{CT} features. Also, the calculation of its achievable data rates.
		\item The analysis and modeling of the power spectral density of the additive noise found in the Brazilian outdoor electric power grids. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	
	
	Based on the numerical analyses, we state the following remarks:
	
	\textbf{PICORONE: HERE YOU NEED TO EMPHASIZE WHAT IS THE GAIN REGARDING THE THREE AFOREMENTIONED CONTRIBUTIONS IN COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS WORKS. THE COMPARISON IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL CONTRIBUTION. SEE PAPERS OF THIAGO OLIVEIRA RELATED TO INHOME PLC CHANNELS.

	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item It was observed and quantified the time window occupied by the abrupt \ac{ACA} variation due to the cyclic switching of charges synchronized with the electric power network. 
		Statistically, \color{blue} with a good approximation, \ac{RMS-DS} observed values follow the inverse Gaussian probability distribution; \color{black} 
		\item Only in 20\% of the analyzed cases the \ac{CT} \color{blue} were \color{black} less than, approximately, 2~ms for $\beta = 0.99$ and 5~ms for $\beta = 0.95$. 
		The \ac{CT} was not lower than 1.38~ms and 5.76~ms, for $\beta=0.99$ and $\beta = 0.90$, respectively.
	\end{itemize}
	
	%The results and analyzes are supported by a wide measurement campaign carried out in the \ac{LV-PDN} in the city of Juiz de Fora, Brazil, in order to explore the use of communication systems based on outdoor \ac{PLC} technology. The analyzed channel features are \ac{ACA}, \ac{RMS-DS}, \ac{CB}, \ac{CT} and \ac{ADR}.
	%The main contributions of the present investigation are summarized as follows:
	%\begin{itemize}
	%	\item Some data sets presented (\ac{RMS-DS} and \ac{CB}) were modeled by a statistical distribution in which case several classical continuous distributions are considered;
	%	\item Adherence tests were conducted by evaluating the associated log-likelihood values, which is the adopted metric to support the choice of the best statistical distribution that models such channel parameter;
	%	\item The average duration of the time window occupied by abrupt \ac{ACA} variation of measured outdoor PLC channels was in the first time estimated. Also a robust linear approach of the \ac{ACA} based on the mean square error criterion was presented;
	%	\item A robust approach of the mean measured PLC channel attenuation response based on the mean square error criterion was presented;
	%	\item The relationship between ACA and RMS-DS, RMS-DS and CB in outdoor \ac{PLC} channel were modeled by robust linear approach based on the mean square error criterion; 
	%	\item A mathematical model, based on performed measurements of the noise \ac{PSD} in the \ac{PLC} outdoor communication medium was proposed and the \ac{ADR} of the outdoor PLC channel in the presence both impulsive and background noise was estimated.

	\section{Measurement Setup and Campaign}
	\label{sec:campaign}
	\color{blue} We have evaluated and presented the statistical characterization and features associated with Brazilian outdoor PLC channels by the \ac{CFR} estimations. \color{black}
	The data used to estimate the CFR were produced by a set of measurement equipment during a \color{blue} measuring campaign \color{black} in the city of Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil, as discussed \color{blue} below.\color{black}
	
	\subsection{The Measurement Setup}
	\color{blue} Fig.~\ref{fig:setup} illustrates the block diagram of the adopted measurement setup applied for estimation of \ac{CFR}. It consists of three main components as follows: \color{black}
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item \color{blue} {\bf Signal generator:} \color{black} Device composed of an arbitrary signal generator board mounted in a rugged computer. \color{red}(: Change the sentence to a better one! Do you mean a signal generator has been mounted on rugged computer? or a signal generator with an embedded rugged computer inside? ) \color{black}
		A pre-designed sounding sequence \color{red}( Should it be called "sounding sequence" or it can be changed to "stimulating signal"? I dont know about it. Let me know.)\color{black} is loaded into \color{blue} the device \color{black} and converted \color{blue} into \color{black} an analog signal to be \color{black} induced\color{black} to the electric power grid under analysis;
		\item \color{blue} {\bf Data digitizer:}\color{black}  The device acts as a receiver, measuring the transmitted sounding signal after propagating through the electric power grid,
		and converts it into a digital representation for the subsequent analyzes that will be carried out through digital signal processing-based techniques;
		\item \color{blue} {\bf Coupler:} It is a \color{black} circuitry applied to connect both the signal generator and data digitizer to the electric power grid under analysis.
		The coupler is essentially composed of an analog highpass filter, blocking the main voltage signal ($60$~Hz in Brazil) \color{blue} in order no to \color{black} damage the other equipments \cite{SilvaCosta2017}. 
		Insertion loss lower than 2~dB in the frequency band between 1.7~MHz up to 100~MHz is introduced by adopted coupler.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The set of equipment and algorithms used to inject the test signal \color{red}(is it the same as sounding signal? )\color{black} into the \ac{LV-PDN} is called \color{blue} ``Setup TX''\color{black}. 
	On the other hand, the set of equipment and algorithms used to sample and estimate the \ac{LV-PDN} \ac{CFR} is called \color{blue} ``Setup RX''\color{black}.

		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	
	The \ac{CFR} \color{blue} estimations \color{black} are obtained through the  methodology described in~\cite{Oliveira2014}, which is based on a sounding approach \cite{Parsons1991}. 
	The set of adopted parameters in the estimation methodology is summarized in TABLE~\ref{tab:setup_parameters}.
	Essentially, the transmitted signal is composed of \ac{HS-OFDM} symbols \cite{Ribeiro2014a}. 
	By adopting  $200$~MHz sampling frequency, the frequency resolution is around $48.83$~kHz and each \ac{CFR} estimate is obtained every $23.04~\mu$s, approximately -- for more details see~\cite{Oliveira2013a}. 
	
	\subsection{Measurement Campaign}
	For the analysis of the features of the outdoor PLC channel, 33 cycles of the \ac{LV-PDN} fundamental frequency (60~Hz in Brazil) were considered in a low-income neighborhood of the city of Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil. 
	The distance between the couplers ranged from 3~m up to 100~m, with mean values of 15~m, 50~m and 85~m. 
	In each cycle of the \ac{LV-PDN} (16.67~ms), approximately 723 PLC channel frequency responses were collected with a length of 4,096 samples per CFR, in addition to the cyclic prefix of size equal to 512. 
	With this, 23,919 CFR measurements of outdoor PLC channels were \color{blue} obtained \color{black} in total.
	
	The measurement of the noise in the outdoor PLC channel was performed according to \cite{Andrade2013}, in which groups of 3,500,000 successive samples of voltage in the time domain of the signal on the \ac{LV-PDN} were obtained in the absence of signal emitted by the signal generator. Each sample group corresponds to approximately 17.5~ms. This time was chosen based on the memory capacity of the data acquisition board when set to a sampling rate of 200~Msps. These samples were acquired in one of the three phases of the \ac{LV-PDN} and form the database of outdoor PLC channel noise.

	\section{Features Definitions}
	\label{sec:parameters}
	
	Let us assume the PLC channels are modeled as band limited and frequency selective \ac{WSSUS}. Also, assume that during a certain period of time, the \ac{CIR} is time-invariant. Therefore, the \ac{CIR} of the \ac{PLC} channel is during this certain time interval is  $ h(t)\in \mathbb{R}|t\in[0,T_h)$,  and its corresponding Fourier transform is $H(f)\in \mathbb{C}||f|<B$, in which $B$ is the frequency bandwidth. Note that $h[n]=h(t)|_{t=nT_s}$, in which $n=0,1.2,\cdots,L_h-1 $ and $T_s$ is the sampling period. The features extracted from the Brazilian PLC channels are described in the following subsections. This assumption is taken into account to define \ac{ACA}, \ac{ACFR}, \ac{RMS-DS}, \ac{CT} and \ac{CB}.
	
	\subsection{Average Channel Attenuation}
	The ACA in dB is expressed by
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\textrm{ACA}=-10\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}|H[k]|^2\right) \ \ \ \mbox{[dB]},
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $H[k]$ is the $k^{\rm th}$ coefficient of the discrete channel frequency response for the zero-padded version of the discrete-time impulse response of the time invariant PLC channel $\{h[n]\}_{n=0}^{L_h-1}$ because $L_h \ll N$.
	
	
	\subsection{Average Channel Frequency Response}
	The \ac{ACFR} represents the mean of all measured \ac{CFR} in the measurement campaign carried out, it is expressed by
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\overline{A}_f=20\log_{10}\left[E\{|H[k]|\}\right] \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{[dB]},
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $E\{\cdot\}$ denotes the expectation operator.
	
	\subsection{Root Mean Squared Delay Spread}
	The RMS-DS represents the distribution of the transmitted power over various paths in a multipath environment,
	and can be defined as the square root of the second central moment of a power delay profile.
	For a discrete-time channel impulse response, the RMS-DS ($\sigma_{\tau}$) is expressed as
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\sigma_{\tau}
	= T_{s}\sigma_{0}
	= T_{s}\sqrt{\mu{}_{0}^{'}-\mu_{0}^{2}},
	\end{eqnarray}
	where
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\mu_{0}=\frac{\overset{L_h-1}{\underset{n=0}{\sum}}n|h\left[n\right]|^{2}}{\overset{L_h-1}{\underset{n=0}{\sum}}|h\left[n\right]|^{2}}\
	~~ {\rm and} ~~
	\mu_{0}^{'}=\frac{\overset{L_h-1}{\underset{n=0}{\sum}}n^{2}|h\left[n\right]|^{2}}{\overset{L_h-1}{\underset{n=0}{\sum}}|h\left[n\right]|^{2}},
	\end{eqnarray}
	and $T_s=1/f_s$ is the sampling period.
	Note that $\sigma_{0}$ is the RMS-DS normalized to a unitary sampling time,
	$\mu_{0}$ is the average delay
	and $h[n]$ is the $n^{\rm th}$ sample of the discrete-time channel impulse response. The channel impulse response is evaluated over the support of the channel impulse response in the discrete-time domain.
	
	\subsection{Coherence Bandwidth}
	The coherence bandwidth reflects how selective the channel frequency response is, being determined by
	\begin{eqnarray}
	R(e^{j\omega})=\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} H(e^{j\omega})H^*(e^{j\omega+\Delta\omega})d \omega,
	\label{eq:CB}
	\end{eqnarray}
	in which $H(e^{j\omega})$ is the Fourier transform of the discrete-time representation of a linear and time invariant PLC channel and  $0 \leq \Delta \omega \leq 2\pi$ denotes the angular frequency resolution in the transform domain. The value of the coherence bandwidth ($\Delta \omega_{B_c}$) in the discrete-time domain is such that
	\begin{eqnarray}
	|R(e^{j\Delta \omega_{B_c}})|=\gamma|R(1)|,
	\label{eq:CB}
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $0<\gamma<1$ is the correlation level informing that the channel frequency response does not vary considerably when $\Delta \omega \in [0,\Delta \omega_{B_c}]$. Assuming a sampling frequency equal to $f_s=2B$~Hz, in which $B$ is the frequency bandwidth, then the coherence bandwidth ($B_c$) is expressed as
	\begin{eqnarray}
	B_c=\frac{\Delta \omega_{B_c}}{2\pi}f_s.
	\label{eq:CB}
	\end{eqnarray}
	The CB estimates from the measured PLC channels are analyzed with respect to the correlation coefficient $\gamma = 0.9$. 
	
	\subsection{Coherence Time}
	The coherence time is the time duration in which the channel impulse response of a PLC channel is considered time invariant. Following~\cite{Picorone2014}, the evaluation of the coherence time may be carried out by assuming that the PLC channel is an \ac{WSSUS} process. Then, the coherence time of the channel is related to the coherence time of the complex gains of the channel, $\alpha_l(t)$, which incorporate both attenuation and phase deviations due to $l = 1,2,\ldots,L$ multiple reflections of the signal in the communication medium.  
	
	In its turn, the coherence index between samples of $\alpha_l(t)$, taken $\Delta t$ time units apart, is given by
	\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq-correlindex}
	\rho_{\alpha_l}=\frac{E[\alpha_l(t)\alpha^*_l(t+\Delta t)]}{E[|\alpha_l^2(t)|]},
	\end{eqnarray}
	in which $E[.]$ is the expectation operator and $*$ denotes the conjugate operator. 
	Thus, it can be assumed that the correlation index of the PLC channel is given by
	\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq-correl}
	\rho_{h}(\Delta t)=\frac{\sum_{l=1}^L P_l \rho_{\alpha_l}(\Delta t)}{\sum_{l=1}^L P_l}; \ \ 0\leq |\rho_h(\Delta t)|\leq 1,
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $P_l= E[|\alpha_l^2(t)|]$ is the average power of the  $l^{\rm th}$ path. Hence, the CT of the channel can be obtained through
	\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq-correlfinal}
	|\rho_h(T_c^{\beta})|\geq \beta,
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $0 <\beta < 1$ refers to the minimum correlation index admitted to characterize the channel as time-invariant during the time interval $\Delta t =T_c^{\beta}$. By adopting an hermitian symmetric orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (HS-OFDM) scheme, which is the version of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme for baseband data communication \cite{Ribeiro2014a}, the CT for the correlation index $\beta$, denoted by $T_{c}^{\beta}$, can be estimated by using~\cite{Picorone2014} 
	\begin{eqnarray}
	T_{c}^{\beta} = M_c(2N+L_{cp})T_s,
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $M_c$ is the number of consecutive channel estimates that is needed to reach a correlation equal to $0<\beta<1$, where
	$T_s=1/f_s$ denotes the sampling period, $2N$ is the number of subcarriers and $L_{cp}$ is the length of the cyclic prefix in the HS-OFDM symbol.
	
	\subsection{Achievable Data Rate}
	
	Let us assume that the PLC channel being frequency selective, the additive noise being colored Gaussian random process, $N$ ensures that the subchannels as flat and the \ac{PSD} of the additive noise flat, then the achievable data rate can be obtained by using \cite{Cover2006}
	\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-txMedia}
	R = \mbox{max}_{S_x[k]} \ \ \frac{B}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\log_2\left(1+ \frac{S_x[k]|H[k]|^2}{S_n[k]}\right)\ \ \ \mbox{[bps]},
	\end{eqnarray}
	subject to $\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} BS_x[k] \leq P_x$. Note that $S_x[k]$ and  $S_n[k]$ denote the \ac{PSD} of the transmitted signal at the $k$th subcarrier and the \ac{PSD} of the additive noise in the $k$th subchannel. Also, $P_x$ is the total transmission power.
	
	
	\section{Results} \label{sec-caracteristicas_canal_outdoor} 
	This paper presents some important discussions about key parameters estimated from measured Brazilian outdoor PLC channels. These channel parameters are \ac{ACA}, \ac{ACFR}, time duration of impulsive response, \ac{RMS-DS}, \ac{CB}, \ac{CT} and achievable data rate. The analyzes were performed considering the distance between the measurement equipments (Setup TX end Setup RX) ranging from 3~m up to 100~m, with average distances of 15~m, 50~m and 85~m and encompasses the frequency band ranging from 1.7 MHz up to 100 MHz.
	
	Some data sets presented (RMS-DS and CB) are modeled by a statistical distribution in which case some continuous distributions are considered, including both symmetric (Logistic, Normal and t-Student) and asymmetric (Exponential, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian, Log-logistic, Log-normal, Nakagami, Rayleigh, Rician and Weibull) distributions. Adherence tests are conducted by evaluating the associated log-likelihood values, which is the adopted metric to support the choice of the best statistical distribution that models such channel parameter.
	
	\subsection{Average Channel Attenuation}\label{sec-aca}
	The relation between \ac{ACA} and the channel length can be observed in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ACAxDist}. As expected, the channel attenuation increases as the channel length increases, with a linear ratio of 0.4 dB/m for the measured Brazilian outdoor PLC channels.
	A robust linear approach of the ACA (Model in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ACAxDist}) based on the mean square error criterion can be given by 
	\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-ACAxDist}
	\widetilde{A}_c(d) = 0.4d +16.71 \   \  \mbox{[dB]},    
	\end{eqnarray}
	where  $\widetilde{A}_c$ indicates the ACA that the PLC signal will suffer and $d$ is the distance (in meters) between transmitter and receiver.

			\caption{Average channel attenuation depending on the distance between the transmitter and receiver of \ac{PLC} signals.}
			\label{Fig:ACAxDist}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	
	Fig.~\ref{Fig:SenoJanelaZero} illustrates the variation of \ac{ACA} value of one \ac{PLC} outdoor channel. By comparing with the main signal magnitude ($60$~Hz in Brazil), these variations in ACA amplitude occurs in a time window centered at the instant time in which the \ac{LV-PDN} main signal crosses the zero. The observed average duration of the time window occupied by the abrupt \ac{ACA} variation of measured outdoor PLC channels was $T_{W^{120}} = 0.98$~ms, since the observed values ranged from 0.73~ms up to 1.40~ms. 
	This \ac{ACA} alteration is related to the switching synchronized with the fundamental frequency of the loads connected to the electric power network. This abrupt and cyclic change in the \ac{ACA} has been reported in other papers for indoor \ac{PLC} channels \cite{Corripio2006, Oliveira2017}.

	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Average Channel Frequency Response}
	The magnitude response of measured PLC channels, in terms of maximum, mean and minimum value, is depicted in Fig.~\ref{Fig:CFRmedia}. As can be seen, the mean value of the magnitude response of outdoor PLC channels exhibit a decay rate of, approximately, 0.4~dB/MHz. Furthermore, high attenuation is observed at the initial portion of the analyzed spectrum up to 1.7~MHz due to the action of the high-pass filter of the PLC coupler applied in the measurements. Fig.~\ref{Fig:CFRmedia} also shows a robust approach of the mean measured PLC channel attenuation response based on the mean square error criterion, given by
	\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-CFRmedia}
	\widetilde{A}_f(f) = 0.391f+36.3 \   \  \mbox{[dB]},   
	\end{eqnarray}
	with $f$ given in MHz.

	\subsection{Temporal dispersion}\label{sec-rmsds}
	The \ac{RMS-DS} statistics are indicated in Tab.~\ref{Tab:EstatisticasRMS}. As can be observed, the RMS-DS was smaller than $0.22$~ms in 90\% of the analyzed cases.

	\end{table}   
	
	Fig.~\ref{Fig:RMSDS_CDF} shows the empirical \ac{CDF} of the RMS-DS. The RMS-DS presented values between 129.7~$\mu$s and 301.6~$\mu$s following, with good approximation, the inverse gaussian probability distribution ($\mu$ = 0.186993, $\lambda$ = 8.71957).

	\subsection{Root Mean Squared Delay Spread versus Average Channel Attenuation}
	The relation between ACA and RMS-DS in outdoor \ac{PLC} channel can be observed in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ACMxRMSDS}. This relation can be modeled by robust linear approach based on the mean square error criterion, given by   
	\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-ACMxRMSDS}
	\sigma_{\tau} = - 0.01 \times1 0^{-2}A_f + 0.19 \   \  \mbox{[$\mu$s]},    
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $\sigma_{\tau}$ is the RMS-DS in microseconds.

	\subsection{Coherence Bandwidth}\label{sec-bandadecoerencia}
	
	The \ac{CB} statistics are indicated in Tab.~\ref{Tab:EstatisticasCB}, where it is observed that in 90\% of the analyzed cases  \ac{CB} is higher than 351.24~kHz.
	\begin{table}[!htb]

			\hline
		\end{tabular} \label{Tab:EstatisticasCB}
		\newline
	\end{table} 
	
	The empirical CDF of CB is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:BC_CDF}, when  $\gamma = 0.9$ is considered. In this case, CB varies from 247.2~kHz up to 629.2~kHz following, with good approximation, a inverse Gaussian probability distribution ($\mu$ = 430.57, $\lambda$ = 14,323.9).

	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Root Mean Squared Delay Spread versus Coherence Bandwidth}
	
	The relationship between RMS-DS and CB can be verified in Fig.~\ref{Fig:RMSDSxBC}. The derived model was obtained through a robust approximation following a hyperbolic curve, which can be represented by
	\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq-RMSDSxBC}
	B_c^{0.9} = \frac{78.5}{\sigma_{\tau}},    
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $B_c^{0.9}$ refers to the CB when $\varphi=0.9$ in kHz and $\sigma_{\tau}$ is the RMS-DS in $\mu$s.

	\subsection{Coherence time}\label{sec-tempodecoerencia} 
	Fig.~\ref{Fig:TCmedio} illustrates the average evolution of the coherence index between analyzed Brazilian outdoor \ac{PLC} channels. As can be seen, the occurrence of some valleys in the coherence index are due to abrupt change of the \ac{CIR} that occurs in the passage through zero of the fundamental frequency of the electrical energy network.

			\label{Fig:TCmedio}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	
	Fig.~\ref{Fig:TC_CDF} depicts the cumulative distribution function of the \ac{PLC} channel coherence time. As can be seen,  only in 20\% of the analyzed cases the coherence time was less than approximately 2~ms for $\beta = 0.99$, and 5~ms for $\beta = 0.95$.

	\end{figure}
	
	The \ac{CT} statistics are indicated in Tab.~\ref{Tab:EstatisticasCT}, considering $\beta=\{0.90;0.95;0.98;0.99\}$. As can be observed, the coherence time observed from the measurement campaign was not lower than 1.38~ms and 5.76~ms, for $\beta=0.99$ and $\beta = 0.90$, respectively. The highest \ac{CT} value indicated in the TAB was limited by the storage capacity of the consecutive \ac{CFR}s of the measurement equipment (723 \ac{CFR}s) adopted in the measurement campaign.

	\subsection{Noise}\label{sec-ruido}
	In this work, each measured noise group has $N_v=3,500.000$ samples and it is classified as background noise if all of its samples assume values less than $V_{\lim}$. Otherwise, that is, the measured noise group has some sample with an amplitude greater than or equal to $V_{\lim}$, it receives the classification of impulsive noise. Fig.~\ref{Fig:limiteDeciRuidos} illustrates the two classes of noise adopted to model the noise of \ac{LV-PDN} when $V_{\lim}=0.05$~V. In the Figure above the peak value of the noise amplitude did not exceed the decision threshold $V_{\lim}$, so this group of $N_v$ samples is classified as background noise. In the figure below, it is possible to identify that there are samples from the group where their amplitudes exceed the decision threshold, so the group is classified as impulsive noise.

	The PSD of background and impulsive noise can be modeled by
	\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq-psdOutdoor}
	S_n(f) = a + b\log_{10}|f| \ \ \ \mbox{in dBV$^2$/Hz},  
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $a$ and $b$ are parameters dependent on the location of the measurements and $f$ is the frequency in MHz. The values of $a$ and $b$ that model the noise present in the Brazilian \ac{LV-PDN} when considering the band of frequency of 1.7~MHz up to 100~MHz are indicated in Tab.~\ref{Tab:ParamNoise}.

	\subsection{Achievable data rate}
	Thus, we have \ac{ADR} estimate of the outdoor \ac{PLC} channel equivalent of a frequency selective channel whose restrictions on the transmitted signal and additive noise are those described in this section. It was adopted $|H[k]|^2 = 10^{-5}$, $k=0,1,\ldots,N-1$, i.e, $\widetilde{A}_f(50\ \mbox{MHz}) \approx  50$~dB (Fig.~\ref{Fig:CFRmedia}). Fig. \ref{Fig:Capacidade} shows the achievable data rate of outdoor PLC in the presence both background and impulsive noise when considering the frequency band of 1.7-100 MHz.

	\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusao}
	This work presented the results of a comprehensive measurement campaign with the aim of characterizing and modeling the Brazilian \ac{LV-PDN} as a means of data communication in the frequency band from 1.7~MHz up to 100~MHz.
	
	Concerning the calculation of the coherence band and coherence time, it has been proposed to consider the outdoor \ac{PLC} channel as having scattering uncorrelated and stationary in the broad sense. This modeling proved to be feasible since the lowest coherence time of the \ac{PLC} outdoor channel found during the measurement campaign was 207~$\mu$s, which is much longer than 23,4~$\mu$s in which corresponds to the duration of the transmitted symbol. 
	
	Statistical models that represent the RMS-DS and CB of the measured channels were presented. Also, the temporal window statistic and average gain variation that occur due to periodic cyclic variations in the frequency response of the \ac{PLC} channel was discussed at the first time.
	
	Mathematical models, based on only two parameters, representing the background and impulsive noises present in \ac{LV-PDN} have been proposed.
	
	Finally, the achievable data rate of the outdoor PLC channel in the presence both impulsive and background noise was estimated.
